    "courseName": "Special Paper in Military History",
    "about": "Every year this course explores some aspect of the military history of Asia. We do this by identifying a particular theme we can use to unpack, and analyze, a wider array of questions. This year we will examine a topic that is so fundamental to the study of military history that it forms the essential connection between war on the one hand and the wider human experience on the other. It can be summarized in a snappy old quote: “it is easy to start a fight, the challenge is to stop one.”"

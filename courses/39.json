    "about": "This course will focus on the colonial period in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. In addition to the political, social, and economic effects of colonial rule in each of these countries, attention will be given to the evolution of 'Indochina' as an entity created by the French and to its impact on relations among the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao peoples.

    "courseName": "Technology and Culture in the Asia-Pacific",
    "about": "This course will introduce Asian, European, and American material from the late nineteenth century to nearly the present day, concentrating on social and cultural themes such as industrialization, colonialism, science and race, technology and war, computers and global telecommunications and biotechnology and the human genome project. It will be taught as a series of cases illustrating important events and multiple themes. The proposition that modern science and technology have been 'socially constructed', reflecting political and cultural values as well as the state of nature, will be examined rather closely. Some theoretical material will leaven our otherwise empirical focus."

    "about": "This seminar explores China's place within the larger maritime world, beginning with the voyages of Ming dynasty eunuch Zheng He and culminating in the South China Sea dispute in our time. We will focus partly on states and societies that claimed Chinaâ€™s coastal regions and the oceanic spaces surrounding it, and partly on the networks, institutions, and economies linking China to a wider maritime sphere. Readings will be drawn from both primary sources and scholarship on topics such as the Zheng organization on Taiwan, steamships, overseas migration, fishing, smuggling, and reform and opening in the late 20th century."

    "courseName": "Minorities in Southeast Asia",
    "about": "With the creation of colonial states in Southeast Asia, certain peoples in the region became minorities owing to their languages, religious beliefs or customary practices. Examples include the Shan and Karen in Myanmar, Muslim minorities in Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines, the people of the Mountain Province in the Philippines, Christian communities in Indonesia, the hill peoples of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and animist groups in Borneo and the Eastern archipelago. Colonial administrations often made special provisions for these minorities, but with independence the dominant ideology across the region called for a single national identity within each nation-state. This course examines the position of minorities under colonial and post-colonial governments. It surveys the minorities of the region, and develops case studies dealing with selected groups. This course is designed for students throughout NUS with an interest in history."

    "about": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to modern microeconomic theory. It is the first of two courses (the other being EC6101) in the core microeconomics sequence of the economics doctoral programme. The course covers consumer theory, general equilibrium theory, and game theory. Knowledge of undergraduate economics is not essential for the course, but students are expected to be comfortable with linear algebra, multivariate calculate and real analysis, and be capable of understanding and producing mathematically rigorous proofs."

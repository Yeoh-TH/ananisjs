    "courseName": "Edge of Empires: The Sino-Southeast Asian Borderlands",
    "about": "Between China, India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam lies an expansive region of mountains and valleys populated for centuries by upland peoples, scattered townsfolk, traders, fugitives, and insurgents. Through a range of historical, ethnographic, and primary source accounts, this course puts these often-marginalized figures at the center. We examine their motives for engaging or avoiding the states all around: imperial China and Vietnam, British and French colonial regimes, and modern nation-states of all kinds. At the same time, we also study the efforts of state or lowland actors to capture, control, convert, aid, and “civilize” the peoples of the borderlands."

    "courseName": "Early Chinese Historiography",
    "about": "This course will explore the foundational works of China’s long historiographical tradition, focusing on the Zuo zhuan (Zuo commentary) and Sima Qian’s Shiji (Records of the Grand Scribe), which together established the models for all subsequent acts of historical writing in China. Through close reading of selected passages from these two works, students will come to appreciate the conventions, literary devices, and motivations that underlay them, and better understand the roles that source selection, narrative construction, and critical evaluation of evidentiary sources played in their creation."

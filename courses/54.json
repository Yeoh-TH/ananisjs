    "about": "This course studies money and its role in economic systems from an interdisciplinary perspective. We examine 5,000 years of monetary development and trace the changes in the institutions of monetary governance and stability, both domestic and international. We examine the development of monetary economics and the interplay between theory and actual monetary arrangements. We then discuss contemporary philosophical and political debates surrounding the allocation and use of the powers of money creation and destruction, including digital currencies, quantitative easing, and “modern monetary theory”."

    "about": "Political economy studies conflict management: it explains political and economic behaviour by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. This course will introduce students to a broad class of potential interactions between political and economic actors, not only in the context of economically developed countries and consolidated democracies, but also exploring autocratic regimes, failed states, and emerging economies. Course materials will describe important empirical regularities in order to help identify key questions, guide model-building efforts, evaluate the usefulness of the economic models, and provide perspective on major politico-economic developments."

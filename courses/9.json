    "courseName": "Macroeconomic Analysis III",
    "about": "This course is divided into two sections; long‐ and short‐ run macro‐economic analysis. In the first section, we shall discuss various theories of economic growth using inter‐temporal optimization models, which include neo‐classical growth models and overlapping‐generations models. In the second section, we shall add stochastic elements to the standard neo‐classical growth model and use it to study business cycles. Our focus will be to highlight the similarities and differences between the Real Business Cycle and New‐Keynesian Models. This course is suitable for students intending to pursue graduate studies or quantitative research (in ministries, statutory boards, etc.) in Economics."

    "courseName": "Econometrics III",
    "about": "This course is aimed at consolidating what was covered in Econometrics I and II and provide a reasonable training in econometric theory and sound empirical analyses. The course will review probability and statistics theory, and cover asymptotic theory, linear and non-linear models, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood estimation, and other topics in modern econometrics. The course will be highly useful for honours theses that deal with applied problems."

    "about": "This course studies techniques for forecasting, evaluating forecast performance and associated uncertainty, and comparing and combining forecasts that are tailored to the typical characteristics of economic and financial data. The emphasis is put on application of these techniques to forecasting real world data using a popular software package such as Stata or EViews."

    "courseName": "Applied Microeconomic Analysis",
    "about": "The course covers selected topics including economics of asymmetric information, auction and mechanism design, and matching and market design. The course will focus on delivering the economic insights and minimize the use of mathematical tools. Emphasis will be placed on main applications such as design of efficient and revenue‐maximizing auctions, design of stable school choice mechanisms, and design of efficient and optimal contracts."

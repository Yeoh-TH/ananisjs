    "courseName": "Total War, 1815-1945",
    "about": "After 1815, the Industrial Revolution and mass politics changed warfare. The new pattern of Modern War that emerged led to a further and more dramatic change: war between great industrial powers for unlimited ends, using unlimited means. Why did this happen and how did it affect the course of history? This course will pursue this question, analyzing changes in the nature and pattern of warfare to identify and explore the characteristics of Total War. It will concentrate on the Second World War.

This course is designed for students throughout NUS with an interest in history."

    "about": "This course - which is offered to all students with an interest in Modern European History - will explore the significant features and impact of nationalism, imperialism and adventurism as they relate to Europe in the dramatic seventy-year period from the upheavals of the 1848 revolutions to the end of the First World War. During this period Europe became the center of a new and deadly game of power politics in which any semblance of defeat was reason enough to prepare the ground for revenge. Eventually, war took its toll on every major participant from 1914-18."

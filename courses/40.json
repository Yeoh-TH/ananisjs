    "courseName": "Engendering History/Historicising Gender",
    "about": "Gender history emerged as a scholarly discipline in the late 20th century as a way to challenge established historical narratives that overlooked the roles and experiences of women. The field has evolved considerably over time, moving away from the recovery of women in history towards a reconceptualization of gender as intimately related to power. This course adopts a historical perspective on the ways in which gender has served as a tool for articulating and naturalising differences and examines how gender intersects with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality, to understand power dynamics and social inequalities. Students will read seminal texts from the ever growing field of gender history and explore the differing ways in which scholars have approached history through the lens of gender."

    "courseName": "Love: Histories of an Emotion",
    "about": "Is love universal? How have concepts and expressions of love changed over time? What does a history of love tell us about politics, social norms, cultural artefacts, religious practices and gender relations in any society? Using historiographical tools from the history of the emotions, we will examine different kinds of love in diverse regions across the centuries: family, platonic, courtly, divine, romantic and erotic love; lovesickness, unrequited and forbidden love. Drawing from ars erotica, courtly romances, talismans, spells, romantic poetry and love letters, this course is intended to encourage students to think widely about cultural specificities and universal emotions."

    "courseName": "International History of SE Asia",
    "about": "Situated between India and China, Southeast Asia in historical times became an important economic and geostrategic nexus in the context of the international trade that stretched from Europe to China and the big power rivalry that accompanied it. As its significance grew, internal conditions within Southeast Asia adjusted to accommodate increased external contacts while the rival powers, including those from the periphery and from without the region, increasingly saw Southeast Asia as an element in the global power game. This course will examine the structure of Southeast Asia's history within this global context, relating the nature and sequence of its history to developments in the wider international milieu."

    "courseName": "Southeast Asia: Decolonization & After",
    "about": "That the Second World War impacted Southeast Asia is beyond doubt. But the significance of its impact on the structure of the region's 'contemporary' history is more debatable, for revisionist historians are wont to discount the thesis that the War represented a significant turning point or watershed which 'transformed' the region's history. Drawing on both country and regional perspectives, this course first assesses the impact of the War on the theme of decolonization, perhaps the one major historically significant process to dominate the region's political terrain in the immediate post-war aftermath. It will further examine the challenges and trials confronting the new states \"after\" decolonization, in particular, their search not only for new political frameworks to replace the colonial structures they had discarded, but also for solutions to mitigate the issues of social integration, inter-state conflict and regional co-operation."

    "courseName": "Society & Economy in Late Imperial China",
    "about": "This course explores the social and economic changes in late imperial China from the Tang-Song transition to the end of Qing. The central themes include the periodization of the imperial period in Chinese history, agricultural and urban development, and population growth. This course highlights their relevance to world history. Key questions include why and how Chinaâ€™s modern transition differed from what we have conventionally understood as a general modernization pattern, the crucial role played by energy resources and the environment in this transition, and what lingering effects such a pattern left on the present-day economic development in China."

    "about": "This course will trace the historical development of the major Western and Central European Powers from the late 1930s up to the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of Germany in October 1990. Apart from the international challenges posed by the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War, the European states were also beset by numerous acute domestic crises that required remedial treatment by their governments. Some received it and prospered, others did not and languished."
